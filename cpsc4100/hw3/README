CreateBalancedBST:
    Big-O: n, you have to go through the provided array in order to fully put the tree together.

zigzagLevelTraversal:
    Big-O: n, you have to go through the whole tree to record all the data, before listing them off, so before simplification its 2n

gap:
    Big-O: log(n), both targets could be on the bottom level, so before simplification its 2log(n)

pathSum:
    Big-O: log(n), both targets could be on the bottom level, so before simplification its 2log(n)

kthLargest:
    Big-O: log(n), because it could be at the bottom of the tree.
