Problem 1:
    Recurrence Relation:2*T(n/2) + n 
    Same as merge sort

    O Notation: O(n^1 log n)
    a = 2, b = 2, d = 1, b^d = 2^1 = 1
Problem 2:
    Recurrence Relation:2*T(n/2) + n 

    O Notation: O(n^1 log n)
    a = 2, b = 2, d = 1, b^d = 2^1 = 1
Problem 3:
    Recurrence Relation: 3*T(n/2) + n
    
    O Notation: O(n^[log(2) 1])
    a = 3, b = 2, d = 1, b^d = 2 ^ 1 = 1

Personal Note: A majority of my time on this project was spent wrestling with long long instead of the actual problem, it was reather annoying
