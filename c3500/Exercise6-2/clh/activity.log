  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /opt/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

 Both python2 and python3 are installed.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mgrep[0m searches for [4mPATTERNS[24m in each [4mFILE[24m.  [4mPATTERNS[24m is one or more patterns separated by newline characters, and [1mgrep[0m prints each line that matches[m
       a pattern.  Typically [4mPATTERNS[24m should be quoted when [1mgrep[0m is used in a shell command.[m
[m
       A [4mFILE[24m of â€œ[1m-[0mâ€ stands for standard input.  If no [4mFILE[24m is given, recursive searches examine the working directory, and  nonrecursive  searches  read[m
       standard input.[m
[m
       In  addition,  the  variant  programs  [1megrep[0m,  [1mfgrep[0m  and  [1mrgrep[0m  are the same as [1mgrep[0m [1m-E[0m, [1mgrep[0m [1m-F[0m, and [1mgrep[0m [1m-r[0m, respectively.  These variants are[m

              Interpret [4mPATTERNS[24m as basic regular expressions (BREs, see below).  This is the default.[m
[m
       [1m-P[0m, [1m--perl-regexp[0m[m
              Interpret I<PATTERNS> as Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCREs).  This option is experimental when combined with the [1m-z[0m  ([1m--null-data[0m)[m
              option, and [1mgrep[0m [1m-P[0m may warn of unimplemented features.[m

       [1m-e[0m [4mPATTERNS[24m, [1m--regexp=[0m[4mPATTERNS[24m[m
              Use  [4mPATTERNS[24m  as  the patterns.  If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the [1m-f[0m ([1m--file[0m) option, search for all patterns[m
              given.  This option can be used to protect a pattern beginning with â€œ-â€.[m
[m
       [1m-f[0m [4mFILE[24m, [1m--file=[0m[4mFILE[24m[m
              Obtain patterns from [4mFILE[24m, one per line.  If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the [1m-e[0m ([1m--regexp[0m)  option,  search  for[m
              all patterns given.  The empty file contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.[m

       find - search for files in a directory hierarchy[m
[m
[1mSYNOPSIS[0m[m
       [1mfind[0m [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression][m
[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of [1mfind[0m.  GNU [1mfind[0m searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by evaluating the[m
       given expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand  side[m
       is false for [4mand[24m operations, true for [4mor[24m), at which point [1mfind[0m moves on to the next file name.  If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.[m
[m
       If  you  are  using [1mfind[0m in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are writable by[m
       other users), you should read the `Security Considerations' chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called [1mFinding[0m [1mFiles[0m and  comes  with[m
       findutils.   That document also includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful source of inforâ€[m
       mation.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       The [1m-H[0m, [1m-L[0m and [1m-P[0m options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files  or  diâ€[m
       rectories  to  be  examined, up to the first argument that begins with `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments[m
       are taken to be the expression describing what is to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is used.  If no expression  is[m
       given, the expression [1m-print[0m is used (but you should probably consider using [1m-print0[0m instead, anyway).[m
[m
       This  manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of [1mfind[0m but are specified immediately afâ€[m
       ter the last path name.  The five `real' options [1m-H[0m, [1m-L[0m, [1m-P[0m, [1m-D[0m and [1m-O[0m must appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash [1m--[0m  could[m
       theoretically be used to signal that any remaining arguments are not options, but this does not really work due to the way [1mfind[0m determines the end[m
       of the following path arguments: it does that by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a `-').  Now, if a path  arguâ€[m
       ment  would  start  with a `-', then [1mfind[0m would treat it as expression argument instead.  Thus, to ensure that all start points are taken as such,[m
       and especially to prevent that wildcard patterns expanded by the calling shell are not mistakenly treated as expression arguments, it is generally[m
       safer to prefix wildcards or dubious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names starting with '/'.[m
[m
       -P     Never  follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When [1mfind[0m examines or prints information about files, and the file is a symâ€[m
              bolic link, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.[m
[m
       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When [1mfind[0m examines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from  the  properties  of[m
              the  file  to which the link points, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or [1mfind[0m is unable to examine the file to[m
              which the link points).  Use of this option implies [1m-noleaf[0m.  If you later use the [1m-P[0m option, [1m-noleaf[0m will still be in effect.  If [1m-L[0m is in[m
              effect  and  [1mfind[0m  discovers  a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be[m
              searched.[m
[m
              When the [1m-L[0m option is in effect, the [1m-type[0m predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points  to  rather[m
              than  the link itself (unless the symbolic link is broken).  Actions that can cause symbolic links to become broken while [1mfind[0m is executing[m
              (for example [1m-delete[0m) can give rise to confusing behaviour.  Using [1m-L[0m causes the [1m-lname[0m and [1m-ilname[0m predicates always to return false.[m
[m
       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing the command line arguments.  When [1mfind[0m examines or prints  information  about  files,[m
              the  information  used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this behaviour is when a file[m
              specified on the command line is a symbolic link, and the link can be resolved.  For that situation, the information  used  is  taken  from[m
              whatever  the  link  points  to  (that  is, the link is followed).  The information about the link itself is used as a fallback if the file[m
              pointed to by the symbolic link cannot be examined.  If [1m-H[0m is in effect and one of the paths specified on the command line  is  a  symbolic[m
              link to a directory, the contents of that directory will be examined (though of course [1m-maxdepth[0m [1m0[0m would prevent this).[m
[m
       If  more  than one of [1m-H[0m, [1m-L[0m and [1m-P[0m is specified, each overrides the others; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it is[m
       the default, the [1m-P[0m option should be considered to be in effect unless either [1m-H[0m or [1m-L[0m is specified.[m

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /opt/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

 Both python2 and python3 are installed.

--[ More information ]--

  Enjoy your stay!

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /opt/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

 Both python2 and python3 are installed.

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /opt/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

 Both python2 and python3 are installed.

--[ More information ]--

  For support, questions or comments, contact us on discord or IRC.

  Enjoy your stay!
